Instead of lag spikes every 5 minutes..
✅ Smooth Chunk Saving - chunks are given a timestamp to be saved every 5 minutes, defaulting at 10 per tick; instead of all at once.
✅ Data Saving - Playr and data files that usually take multiple seconds to save are now seamlessly done in the background.

✅ Entity AI control - mobs that are not important or near a player have their AI turned off, including support for vaults.
✅ Safely shutting down the server - an option recommended mostly for pterodactyl; this will fully turn your server off after minecraft finishes saving.
✅ Crash Detection - receive alerts to your discord server with a detailed crash report.

For larger servers
✅ Extreme mob control - mobs will spawn in a wave at night, instead of 24/7. This feature drastically reduces MSPT
